 * curl_url() sets the URL (or NULL) to parse. Returns error code.  If

 * The given input URL will be parsed and split up into its components and if
 * any syntax error is found, this function returns the applicable error code.
 * This will never trigger any network use. A URL deemed to be valid by this
 * function will be considered valid by other libcurl operations as well.
 *
 * Flags
 *
 * - CURLURL_NON_SUPPORT_SCHEME allows schemes this libcurl does not
 *   support. If not set, this function returns CURLURLE_UNSUPPORTED_SCHEME
 *   for those.
 * - CURLURL_VERIFY_ONLY makes this function *not* create an output handle but
 *   will still return OK/error regarding the URL syntax.
 * - CURLURL_CONVERT_SPACES tells the function to not consider ascii space to
 *   be an error and instead convert them to %20.
 * - CURLURL_CONVERT_8BIT tells this function to convert 8 bit (>127) byte
 *   values to %xx. URLs are typically 7 bit only so such input is nornally a
 *   mistake.
 * - CURLURL_CONVERT_SLASHES makes the parser allow scheme:/host and
 *   scheme:///host as if they were correct.

 * for SCHEME
 *
 * - CURLURL_DEFAULT_SCHEME makes this function return "https" instead of

 *
 * for PORT

 * Note that the port, while being a number, will be returned as a string just
 * like all other URL parts.
 *
